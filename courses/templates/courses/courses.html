            <h2>1 Day Course</h2>
            <p>The one day course is held on one day of the weekend and takes about 5 hours. The course is focused on new beginners, who would like to get to know more about pottery and making their first few items. In the beginning there will be a short introduction to pottery and how to use the tools. The clay will already be prepared and there will be help provided to get started on the spinning tool. During the course you will create your first pottery items and you can choose in which color I will burn them. Due to the limited time, it is not possible to burn them yourself, unless you will book an additional day course a week later. Finished products can be picked up at my store in Vasastan once they are ready. </p>

            <h2>Weekend Course</h2>
            <p>The weekend course can be for new beginners or advanced students. The course includes the whole process of pottery. From preparing your clay, setting it right on the spinning wheel, to the pottery part itself, decorating the clay afterwards to colouring and burning on the second day.  On the second day you can also create more pottery items that I will then burn myself later onwards due to the extra time that the clay needs to dry before it is possible to burn it.</p>

            <h2>General information</h2>

If you already have pre knowledge or want to perform only certain tasks that is all possible.
